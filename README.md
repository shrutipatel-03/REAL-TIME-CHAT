Task Description: Real-Time Chat Application
The objective of this task is to design and build a real-time chat application using WebSockets for real-time communication and a front-end framework such as React.js or Vue.js for building an interactive user interface.

This application will allow users to join a chat room, exchange messages instantly with others, and view chat history. It simulates the core functionality of modern messaging platforms, enabling real-time user-to-user communication over a persistent WebSocket connection.

Key Features to Implement:
User Entry Screen: A clean landing page where users can input their name and click a ‚ÄúJoin Chat‚Äù button.

Real-Time Messaging: Once inside the chat, users should be able to send and receive messages without refreshing the page.

Message Bubbles: Differentiate between the sender and receiver using styled message bubbles (e.g., different colors or alignment).

Chat History: Display all past messages from the current session in chronological order.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the chat interface works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technologies to Use:
React.js / Vue.js for creating a dynamic, responsive UI

CSS/Flexbox/Grid for styling and layout

WebSocket API or tools like Socket.IO for real-time data transmission

Optionally, use localStorage to retain the chat history on page reload

Deliverables:
A polished and responsive chat interface

Real-time message exchange with visible history

A user-friendly layout with a professional look

Optionally, display a message at the bottom (e.g., ‚Äúüéì Certificate will be issued on your internship end date ‚Äî CodTech‚Äù)

This project is a great opportunity to apply your frontend and WebSocket knowledge to build a real-world, interactive application. It enhances your understanding of real-time data flow, UI state updates, and responsive design.
